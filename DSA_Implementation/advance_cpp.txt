Functors(not functions):



In linkedlist:

 ListNode start = NULL;
 ListNode* tmp = &start;
        

here start has another name. It's called Sentinel Node. Sentinel nodes are widely used for trees and linked lists as pseudo-heads, pseudo-tails, etc. They are purely functional and usually don't hold any data. Their primary purpose is to standardize the situation to avoid edge case handling. For example, let's use here pseudo-head with zero value to ensure that the situation "delete the list head" could never happen, and all nodes to delete are "inside" the list.
