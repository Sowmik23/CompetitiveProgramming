#Difference between auto and auto&
Yes, it is correct to use auto and auto& for local variables. When getting the return type of a function,
it is also correct to use auto&. This applies for range based for loops as well.

General rules for using auto are:

Choose auto x when you want to work with copies.
Choose auto &x when you want to work with original items and may modify them.
Choose auto const &x when you want to work with original items and will not modify them.
