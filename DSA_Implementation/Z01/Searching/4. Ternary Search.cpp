// Why binary search preferred over ternary search?
/// Ternary search does more comparisons than binary search in 
/// worst case.

// Why Merge Sort divides input array in two halves, why not in three or more parts?
/// Now if you do a three-way merge, you will divide the array by 3. 
/// The difference with the previous method is twofold:

/// The depth of division is now log3n.
/// During merge, instead of comparing 2 elements, you need to find 
/// the minimum of 3 elements.
/// Time: 2 * n * log3n
/// Note that 2 is multiplied because finding the minimum of three 
/// elements consists of 2 operations.


/// Asymptotically, these two are both Î˜(nlogn). 
/// However, perhaps in practice the three-way merge sort would give 
/// better performance because of its log3n. Nevertheless, since log2n 
/// for n = 1000000 is a mere 20, and log3n for the same number is 12.5,
// I doubt this optimization would be really effective unless n is
// quite large.
